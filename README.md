# Notepad
  -  Created backend reading, writing and saving logic for the notepad in C#, and frontend using WPF

## 1. Editing the file in the UI
  -  The spaceholder for user entered content dynamically updates the word count on the bottom left corner of the window

## 2. Saving and opening a random file and about section
  -  Here a random file is opened, and the content is read in the textbox UI. 
  -  An about section which displays the name of the author (i.e. me) and some general information, you might find in orignal notepad

## 3. Saving the file as a new file 
   -  Clicking on Save As button provides a dialog box where user enters the name of the file, and can save the file wherever they want
